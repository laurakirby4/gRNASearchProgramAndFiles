READ ME gRNA Databases

All gRNA database files have been processed, with low quality reads removed, bases trimmed, identical sequences collapsed, and sequences not containing for consecutive Ts removed.  

Seven gRNA database files have been uploaded:

EATRO164PCmitogRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
-gRNA transcriptome of EATRO 164 cells in the procyclic stage.  RNAs were isolated from the mitochondria.

TREU667PCmitogRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
-gRNA transcriptome of TREU 667 cells in the procyclic stage.  RNAs were isolated from the mitochondria.

TREU927PCmitogRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
-gRNA transcriptome of TREU 927 cells in the procyclic stage.  RNAs were isolated from the mitochondria.

EATRO164BSmitoRun1gRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
EATRO164BSmitoRun2gRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
-gRNA transcriptome of EATRO 164 cells in the bloodstream stage.  RNAs were isolated from the mitochondria.

EATRO164BSwholecellRun1gRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
EATRO164BSwholecellRun2gRNA-trimmed-collapsed-polyT-consensus.fa
-gRNA transcriptome of EATRO 164 cells in the bloodstream stage.  RNAs were isolated from whole cells.  These files have signficantly more gRNAs than the mitochondrial files, and it is possible that in sequence the gRNAs were accidentally switched.
